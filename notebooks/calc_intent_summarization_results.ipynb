Can we discuss the strategy behind this to ensure we're making the best choices for success? Also, I haven't had a chance to participate in a quest yet and would like to offer my services, as I am fully committed to the cause of Arthur.\\nPlayer4: Player2, while I appreciate your efforts in team selection, I'm concerned about including Player1 again after a failed quest. It might be prudent to consider other participants who have not yet had the opportunity to demonstrate their loyalty. Can we discuss the possibility of adjusting the team to avoid potential sabotage?\\nPlayer5: I'm concerned about repeating a team selection that includes members from a quest that previously failed. Player2, can you elaborate on your strategy behind this choice? It's important we make informed decisions to ensure success for Arthur's cause.\\n\",\n",
